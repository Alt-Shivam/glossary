## What it is

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol designed to provide security to communications over a network. It simply ensures the secure delivery of data sent over the Internet, avoiding possible monitoring and/or alteration of the data. This protocol is widely used in applications such as  messaging, email, etc.

## Problem it addresses 

Without TLS, sensitive information such as browsing habits, e-mail correspondence, online chats and conferencing calls can easily be traced and modified by others during the transmission. By enabling server and client applications to support TLS ensures that data transmitted between them is encrypted with secure algorithms and not viewable by third parties.

## How it helps

TLS uses a combination of encoding techniques that provides security as well as performance while transmitting the data securely. TLS provides end-to-end security to the data that is sent between applications over the Internet and This ensures that hackers are unable to see and monitor what you transmit which is very useful  sensitive and private information such as credit card numbers, passwords, location etc.
